- Perfect for last-minute guest list changes!

## Netlify üåê

### Steps

1. **Build Your App**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run export  # You'll need to add this script
   ```

   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init

   ```bash
   railway variables set GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   railway variables set GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your-private-key-id
   # ... add all other variables
   ```

## Creating Your QR Code üì±

Once deployed, you'll want to create a QR code for guests to scan:

### Online QR Code Generators
1. [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)
2. [QRCode Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)
3. [Google Charts QR API](https://developers.google.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes)

### Steps
1. Copy your deployed app's URL
2. Paste it into a QR code generator
3. Customize the design (optional):
   - Add your wedding colors
   - Include a logo or heart icon
   - Add text like "Find Your Table"
4. Download as PNG or SVG
5. Print and display at your venue

### QR Code Placement Ideas üí°
- **Welcome table**: Large sign with QR code
- **Guest tables**: Small cards with QR codes
- **Programs**: Include QR code in wedding programs
- **Entrance**: Large banner or easel sign
- **Place cards**: Individual QR codes (if you want to be extra!)

## Testing Your Deployment ‚úÖ

Before the big day, make sure to test:

1. **Different devices**: Test on various phones and tablets
2. **Different names**: Try searching for different guests
3. **Edge cases**: Test names with apostrophes, hyphens, etc.
4. **Network conditions**: Test with slower internet connections

## Monitoring and Analytics üìä

### Vercel Analytics (Recommended)
- Enable Vercel Analytics in your dashboard
- Track how many guests use the app
- Monitor performance and errors

### Google Analytics (Optional)
Add to your `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import Script from 'next/script'

// Add this inside your component
<Script
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_TRACKING_ID"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>
<Script id="google-analytics" strategy="afterInteractive">
  {`
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'GA_TRACKING_ID');
  `}
</Script>
```

## Day-of-Wedding Tips üéâ

1. **Have a backup**: Print a traditional seating chart just in case
2. **Designate helpers**: Have tech-savvy friends help guests who need assistance
3. **Test the QR code**: Make sure it works with the venue's WiFi
4. **Monitor usage**: Keep an eye on any error reports
5. **Quick updates**: You can update your Google Sheet even during the event!

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Deployment Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly
- Look at build logs for specific error messages

**App Loads but Search Doesn't Work**
- Verify Google Sheets API credentials
- Check that your sheet is shared with the service account
- Ensure Sheet ID is correct

**QR Code Doesn't Work**
- Test the URL manually in a browser
