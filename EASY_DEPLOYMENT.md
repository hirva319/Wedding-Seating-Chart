# 🚀 Super Easy Deployment Guide

I've automated most of the deployment work for you! Here's the easiest path from setup to having your QR code ready.

## Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended) ⚡

### Step 1: One-Time Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies and validate setup
npm run setup
```

### Step 2: Deploy with One Command
```bash
# This script handles everything automatically
npm run deploy
```

The deployment script will:
- ✅ Check your environment variables
- ✅ Commit any changes to git
- ✅ Install Vercel CLI if needed
- ✅ Guide you through deployment
- ✅ Handle all the technical details

### Step 3: Generate Your QR Code
```bash
# Replace with your actual deployed URL
npm run generate-qr https://your-app.vercel.app
```

This creates `wedding-seating-qr.png` ready for printing! 🎉

## Option 2: Manual Steps (If You Prefer Control)

### Prerequisites Check
```bash
npm run validate-env
```

### Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Login to Vercel (one time only)
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Your Wedding Day Checklist ✅

- [ ] Google Sheet created with guest names and tables
- [ ] Environment variables configured (`npm run validate-env`)
- [ ] App deployed (`npm run deploy`)
- [ ] QR code generated (`npm run generate-qr`)
- [ ] QR code printed and ready for venue
- [ ] Test the QR code with your phone
- [ ] Backup traditional seating chart (just in case!)

## Pro Tips 💡

1. **Test Everything**: Use `npm run dev` to test locally first
2. **Multiple QR Codes**: Generate several for different venue locations
3. **Update Anytime**: Change your Google Sheet even during the wedding!
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check Vercel analytics to see how many guests use it
5. **Have Backup**: Print a traditional chart as backup

## Need Help? 🆘

If anything goes wrong:

1. **Check the validation**: `npm run validate-env`
2. **Read the detailed guides**: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md` and `DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. **Start fresh**: Delete `.env.local` and start over
4. **Ask for help**: Create an issue in the repository

## What Happens After Deployment 🎉

1. **You get a URL**: Something like `https://wedding-seating-chart.vercel.app`
2. **Generate QR code**: `npm run generate-qr YOUR_URL`
3. **Print and display**: Put the QR code where guests can scan it
4. **Guests scan**: They enter their name and see their table
5. **You relax**: Everything works automatically!
